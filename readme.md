## Overview 
iPhone Twitter client [released in 2011] that allows users to easily follow tweets from professional athletes and associations. The stream app suite of applications included Hoop Stream, MMA Stream, Baseball Stream, Tennis Stream, and Hockey Stream. 

The same code base was used for all the apps with only the images and the initial list of athletes and associations changing. The application would auto update the list of twitter accounts in the app.

Note: I pulled these apps off the Apple app store around the end of 2012.

Feature included:  
* View tweets from a large list of athletes in that sport 
* Reply, retweet, or quote a tweet 
* Follow community reactions via hashtags 
* Open links from tweets directly within the app 
* View the athletes Twitter profile 
* Users could view their own Twitter page and tweets
* Send new tweets 
* Search Twitter 
* Automatic data (user list) updates
